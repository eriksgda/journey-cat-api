## About the project

This project consists of an API developed in Java using the Spring Boot framework, JPA (Java Persistence API), and the H2 database. The API is designed to manage and record information about cat trips, facilitating the organization and tracking of feline adventures. The project adopts best practices for API development, ensuring a clear and user-friendly structure.

### API Features

- Trip Recording: Allows users to create and store details about each cat trip. Users can specify various aspects of the trip, such as location, start and end dates, participants, important links, and planned activities.

- Participants and Activities: In addition to recording the location and dates, it is possible to add information about the participants of the trip and the activities planned for each stage of the journey.

- Important Links: Allows users to add useful links related to the trip, such as information about the destination, recommendations for cat care, or any other relevant resources.
